# snippets
A repository for interesting snippets of code to build better screeps AIs in rust.

This is meant to act as the rust equivalent of the [JavaScript and TypeScript repository of screeps snippets](https://github.com/screepers/screeps-snippets)

If you want to contribute, please open a PR with your additions.

The folder structure is still flexible. Feel free to file your snippet anywhere it makes sense for you.

Keep in minds that all shared snippets are shared under the MIT License.
